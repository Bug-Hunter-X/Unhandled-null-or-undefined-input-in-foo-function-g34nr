This repository contains a JavaScript function that demonstrates an uncommon error handling issue. The function `foo` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. It attempts to add them together, however, it does not handle the case where one or both arguments are `null` or `undefined`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The `bug.js` file shows the original buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.
